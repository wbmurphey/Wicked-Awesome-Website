# Wicked-Awesome-Website
A simple web app I designed which allows users to create an account, log in, view a profile page that is only accessible after a successful login, change users to administrators and vice versa if the currently logged-in account is an administrator already, and log out.

NOTE: I attempted to make this website "in a Boston accent." I have nearly NO knowledge of what a Boston accent sounds like besides from TV and pop-culture, so please do not be offended if you are actually from Boston! While my intention was to make the web app simply in a Boston accent, I feel as though it just sounds overly aggressive. While I am happy with the way the web app performs, I think that my Boston lingo could be improved. One might say that I don't like them apples...
